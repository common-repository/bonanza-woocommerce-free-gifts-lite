== Description ==

Bonanza Free Gifts Plugin for WooCommerce allows you to run free gifts promotions and lure your shoppers to spend more money with your business.

Use Bonanza to run special free gift campaigns like:

= Buy 'X' Get 'X' Free =

With Bonanza Lite, you'll have access to the following rules for setting up your promotions:

1. **Always** - "Get a free gift with your purchase. Add any product to your cart."
The specified free gift will always get added to the cart, irrespective of what the shopper buys

2. **Cart Total** - "Unlock a complementary gift with a purchase of over $X"
The shopper will qualify for a free gift only when the cart total is a specified amount

3. **Product(s)** - "Get a free gift with this product only"
You can associate a free gift with certain item (s) in your store.

Note:

In the Lite Version of the plugin, you can only add a different product as a free gift with purchase.

Also, you can turn on the repeater which means more than one gift will get added to the cart as they add more items to their cart.

This is to encourage volume buying.

E.g: **"Buy More. Get More. Free gift with every pack of supplement you buy."**

In addition to the rules in Lite, here are the rules & options you can unlock in the Pro version

4. **Product Category** - You can attach free gifts to any item bought from a certain category. In that case, whatever item is bought from that category will have the free gift attached.
E.g.:  "Buy any item from category X and unlock a free gift"

5. **Product Tags** - Offer free gift on items with certainly specified tags.

6. **Payment Gateway used** -  You can attach free gift with purchase only if they make the payment from a specified payment gateway.
You may only want to offer them a free gift in case they use a credit card or bank transfers and not on C.O.D - you can do that.
E.g.: "Use your credit/debit card to make the payment and get a free gift shipped with your order"

8. **Coupon Code Used** - These promotions are totally possible with Bonanza Pro.
E.g.: "Get 15% off with coupon code Save15 and get a complimentary free gift"

9. **Order Count** - Order count is the number of times a user has made a purchase from your store.
E.g.: "Get a surprise free gift with your first order" Or "Returning customers get a free gift with their purchase. Make sure you log in to buy"

= In addition, you also get: =

- Scheduler - You can schedule the free gift campaign so that it starts at a set date and ends on a certain date.

E.g: "It's raining gifts! Get a free gift with your purchase till the 25th Dec 7 PM!"

- Same Product - In the Pro version, you can offer the same product as a free gift.

A typical use case is 'Buy a sipper. Get a sipper free!"

= The underlying psychology =

In a research conducted by the Carlson School of Management, they found...

That a hand lotion sold 73% more when a free gift was bundled with it than when it carried an equivalent discount.

Free is powerful and works more effectively than cheap or discounting does.

And if you choose the free gift wisely, people will sample it and come back to buy it - this can increase its sales by as much as 2000%!

Shoppers also love to share their shopping experience when they snag a free gift.

Successful online store owners have been using free gift with purchase to increase their average order value.

Clearly, it's an opportunity which doesn't deserve to be missed.
